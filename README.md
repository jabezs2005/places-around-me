# Places Around Me
## AIM:
To develop a website to display details about the places around my house.
## Design Steps:
### Step 1:
Fork the repository to your github and clone it into a
folder in github.

### Step 2:
Then make sure that django is activated and then start a
new django project.

### Step 3:
Now create a folder called static and within that folder
create a folder called html.

### Step 4:
Now create a file called map.html in that folder.

### Step 5:
Now open google maps and take a screenshot of your
hometown.

### Step 6:
Now open "imagemap.org" and upload your image there
and generate image maps of that using the rectangular
or circle tool.

### Step 7:
Now inside the html folder create the necessary html files
that you've included in the href of the image maps.

### Step 8:
Now push the folder and commit the changes in the
github.

### Code:
## HTML:
map.html

        <p>As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I don't possess specific information about a college referred to as "drbcc Hindu College." It's important to note that educational institutions often undergo changes, and details may vary based on their location and affiliation. If "drbcc" is an acronym for a specific organization or trust associated with the college, additional context could provide a clearer understanding. To acquire the most accurate and current information about drbcc Hindu College, I recommend visiting the official college website, reaching out to the college administration for inquiries, or consulting local educational directories. Exploring these sources should offer a more comprehensive overview, including details on academic programs, faculty, infrastructure, cultural activities, and any unique attributes associated with the institution.</p>
